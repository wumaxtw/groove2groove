# Groove2Groove

This is the source code for Groove2Groove.

For now, this repository contains only the model configuration file [`model.yaml`](model.yaml) with the hyperparameter settings, and the [evaluation functions](groove2groove/eval/). We are working on releasing the Python source code, but choose not to make it publicly available while the paper is under review.

The demo can be found on the [supplementary website](https://groove2groove.telecom-paris.fr/).
